								<p>This course focuses in managing enterprise servers with DevOps culture.
								In this course, students learn the essentials of running a DevOps
							    environment in Linux servers, configuring and managing services, and how to monitor and leverage
								alerting in the DevOps environment by using de facto standard monitoring practices
								and Ansible as its configuration management; the student will also learn how to collaborate
								using Git and use Immutable enviroment using Containerized technologies, and cloud services.
								This course is also designed to mirror the current real-world scenarios we have and how to solve them.</p>

										<h2>Reflection and Learnings</h2>
									</header>
									<p>In this course, I have experienced and learned a lot, specifically about running a DevOps environment on Linux servers. In the prelim period, I have experienced difficulties, especially in implementing ansible roles in the playbook.
										It took me a lot of errors to completely finish the activity. However, with the assistance of my classmates and friends, I was able to fully grasp the concept of a playbook. I learned that communication, helping one another, and researching are essential in this course.
										My skills were tested during the midterm period, particularly when it came to installing monitoring tools. It is enjoyable and helped me to improve my skills and knowledge, which is why in the final period, I was able to finish and quickly understand the activities such as
										Containerized environments, as well as cloud services, must be configured and managed.
									</br> </br> 
									I would also like to give my deepest appreciation to our instructor, Dr. Jonathan Taylar, for teaching and guiding us all 
									throughout this course. I have learned not only about this course, but also about how 
									we will be able to have a successful future. All of your tips will surely help us accomplish the goals that we have created. 
									I am hoping that you will still be our instructor in the second semester.
